		<h1>User Manual</h1>
		<p>Welcome to Team 11's Stock Trader application! Please read the following instructions in order to familiarize yourself with this program.</p>

		<h3>LOGGING IN</h3>

		<p>When logging in, please enter a valid username and password.</p>

		<p>If the username and password do not match in the database, you will not be logged in.</p> 

		<p>Choose "Forgot Password" if you do not remember your login credentials and enter your email.</p>

		<h3>ADDING STOCKS TO PORTFOLIO</h3>

		<p>You can add stocks to your portfolio by entering the name of the stock you wish to add in the search bar underneath the graph, then by clicking "buy" with the quantity you wish to purchase.</p>

		<p>Stocks you have already purchased will appear below the search bar.</p>

		<p>You may also add stocks via the main search bar, and by clicking "Add Stock to Portfolio" when the stock appears in the graph.</p>

		<h3>ADDING STOCKS TO WATCHLIST</h3>

		<p>This process is similar to adding stocks, but searching can only be done through the main search bar at the top of the page. Stocks added to the watchlist should also appear in the graph widget when requested - you can complete the addition to the watchlist by selecting the "Add Stock to Watchlist" button under the graph.</p>

		<h3>MANIPULATING THE GRAPH</h3>

		<p>The graph may be manipulated by choosing watchlist (stocks you are interested in but don't necessarily own) or stocklist (stocks you currently own), and by clicking on the time frame selection to change the scope of the graph.</p> 

		<h3>CHECKING ACCOUNT BALANCE</h3>

		<p>A current account balance should always appear at the right of the main search bar for user reference.</p>
